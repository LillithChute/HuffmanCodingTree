# Huffman Coding Tree
The goal of this assignment is to design and implement a program that can encode and decode data using prefix encodings.

Huffman coding is a data compression algorithm that formulates the basic idea of file compression. In this article, we will talk about fixed and variable length coding, uniquely decoded codes, prefix rules, and the construction of a Huffman tree.
